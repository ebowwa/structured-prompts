# Quick Test Prompt

Copy this into a new Claude Code instance:

```
I'm testing the structured-prompts-ts library at /Users/ebowwa/Desktop/codespaces/structured-prompts-ts.

Please:
1. Read the src/index.ts to understand the exports
2. Create a demo.ts file that creates a SchemaManager, adds a prompt schema, retrieves it, and prints the result
3. Run the demo with bun
4. Show me the output
```
